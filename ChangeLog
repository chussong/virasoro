	* Switched to GNU Autoconf for some reason.
	* ./configure tries to find Mathematica and builds VWSTP if it's found.
	--disable-wstp will stop build of VWSTP even if Mathematica is present.
	* --enable-dev turns on the extra compiler warnings, -Werror, and -g.

	* Programs are now installable -- virasoro in /usr/local/bin, vwstp in
	/usr/local/libexec, and Virasoro.m in ~/.Mathematica/Applications.
	* Accordingly, Virasoro.m can now be loaded with Needs["Virasoro`"].
	* Virasoro.m now looks for vwstp in /usr/local/libexec/ if it's not in the
	local directory.

	* Several new functions for Virasoro.m.

	* Reorganized functions between the various files to improve readability.
	* Replaced the lookup tables that were being passed around with a new
	Access class which keeps its own data.
	* Changed all instances of c-style arrays into std vectors. This seems to
	have come with a minor hit to performance but not going out of bounds is
	nice.
	* Refactored runfile class to get rid of all the damn parser functions.

	* Changed static linking to dynamic in order to avoid having to find paths
	to numeric libraries. WSTP is still statically linked because it still
	needs to be located so we might as well just bake it in.
	* Added some exception handling to string parsing routines. Hopefully this
	will make syntax errors more transparent.
